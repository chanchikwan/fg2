2D finite grid code written in CUDA C
=====================================

The fg2 Code is a grid based code for compressible hydrodynamic flows
with radiation.  It uses various finite difference and finite volume
techniques.  It is implemented in CUDA C and runs efficiently on GPU.

ARCHITECTURE: on a typical stream processor such as an nVidia GPU,
  computation is essentially free.  It is the communication overhead
  that limits the performance of a code.  We design the fg2 framework
  so it can hide latency as much as possible.  We use a modified
  version of "rolling cache" method (Micikevicius 2009) to optimize
  our GPU kernel.
